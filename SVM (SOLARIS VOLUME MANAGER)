SVM (Solaris Volume Manager)
To create SVM volumes, you must first create a state database. The state database is a container for SVM components called metadevices, which include disk sets, concatenated and striped volumes, as well as soft partitions.

Initial Setup
Step 1: Creating a State Database

The first step in setting up SVM is creating a state database.
A state database should be created on a unique slice that is not used for anything else.
It is recommended to have at least three state databases on a system for redundancy.
Example Disk Configuration:

disk1
s0 = 100MB (state database)
s1 = 500MB
s3 = 500MB
s4 = 500MB
sh
# devsadm
# iostat -En
# format
Creating Filesystems:

sh
# newfs /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0s0
Display Volume Table of Contents:

sh
# prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0s2
Step 2: Copying VTOC from disk1 to disk2

Disk2 must be fdisked before it can receive the VTOC of disk1.
sh
# fdisk /dev/rdsk/c0t5d0s2
# prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0s2 | fmthard -s - /dev/rdsk/c0t5d0s2
# prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t5d0s2
Creating State Databases
Create 4 copies of the state database:

sh
# metadb -a -f -c 2 c0t4d0s0 c0t5d0s0
-a: add
-f: force
-c: create 2 copies on each slice
Verify:

sh
# metadb
# metadb -i
Delete database:

sh
# metadb -d c0t4d0s0
Creating Soft Partitions
Create an SVM soft partition on c0t4d0s1 (100MB):

sh
# metainit d10 -p c0t4d0s1
Verify:

sh
# metastat
# metastat -p
# metastat -c
Format and Mount the Soft Partition:

sh
# newfs /dev/md/rdsk/d10
# mkdir /soft1
# mount /dev/md/dsk/d10 /soft1
# df -h
Make the Mount Point Permanent:

sh
# echo "/dev/md/dsk/d10 /dev/md/rdsk/d10 /soft1 ufs 1 yes -" >> /etc/vfstab
# tail -1 /etc/vfstab
Expand the Soft Partition by 100MB:

sh
# metattach d10 100m
# metastat -c
# growfs -M /soft1 /dev/md/rdsk/d10
Delete a Volume in SVM:

Unmount the volume:
sh
# umount /soft1
Remove related line from /etc/vfstab:
sh
# vi /etc/vfstab
Delete the soft partition:
sh
Copy code
# metaclear d10
SVM RAID
Types of RAID Volumes in SVM:

Concatenation volume (concat volume): Stores data vertically, from one disk to another.
Stripe volume sets: Data is striped across disks horizontally in chunks referred to as interlace blocks.
RAID 0:

Create a concat volume set:
sh
# metainit d0 2 1 c0t4d0s1 1 c0t5d0s1
# metastat -p
# metastat -c
Create a stripe volume set:
sh
# metainit d1 1 2 c0t4d0s3 c0t5d0s3
# metastat -c
# metastat -p
Delete RAID 0 volumes:
sh
# metaclear d0
# metaclear d1
RAID 1:

Create a RAID 1 volume:
Create the volume sets:
sh
# metainit d0 1 1 c0t4d0s1
# metainit d1 1 1 c0t5d0s1
Create a one-way mirror set:
sh
# metainit d10 -m d0
Attach the second submirror:
sh
# metattach d10 d1
Converting and Expanding Filesystems
Convert /export/home to an SVM volume:

sh
# metainit -f d7 1 1 c0t0d0s7
# metastat -c
Modify /etc/vfstab:

sh
# vi /etc/vfstab
Add:

bash

/dev/md/dsk/d7 /dev/md/rdsk/d7 /export/home ufs 2 yes -
Reboot the system:

sh

# init 6
Verify and Expand /export/home:

sh

# df -h
# metattach d7 c0t6d0s7
# metastat -c
# growfs -M /export/home /dev/md/rdsk/d7
This guide provides the basic steps for setting up and managing Solaris Volume Manager (SVM) volumes, including creating state databases, soft partitions, RAID configurations, and converting and expanding filesystems.
