         SVM (SOLARIS VOLUME MANAGER)

To create svm volumes , a stste database must be created first. The state database is a container of svm called metadevice. These components include disksets, concat and stripe volumes and well as soft partitions.

IQ: 1st thing to do to set up svm is creating a state database

A state database is recommended to be createwdon a unique slice. the partition cannot be used for anything else. It is recomended to have at least 3 state databases on a system for redundancy purpose

1 )Creating an SVM volume

disk1
s0 = 100mb ==> state database
s1 = 500mb 
s3 = 500mb 
s4 = 500mb 

devsadm
iostat -En
#format

slice

#newfs /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0s0 ==>s1,s3.s4

Display the volume table of content of the sliced disk
#prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0s2 ( It will display only sliced partitions)


2)disk2
copy the volume table of content from disk1 to disk2.
Disk2 must be fdisk before it can receive the vtoc of disk1
#fdisk /dev/rdsk/c0t5d0s2

copy vtoc
#prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t4d0s2 | fmthard -s- /dev/rdsk/c0t5d0s2 (this will slice disk2)
#prtvtoc /dev/rdsk/c0t5d0s2 (to check)
add file system
s0,s1,s3,s4

II) 
1)Create 4 copies of the state database on c0t4d0s0 and c0t5d0s0
#metadb -a -f -c2 c0t4d0s0 c0t5d0s0
-a = add
-f = force
-c = 2 copies on each slice

verify
#metadb (will check disk label)
#metadb -i 

delete database
#metadb -d c0t4d0s0 ( it will delete all state databases on the partition)

2)Create an SVM soft partition on c0t4d0s1 (100mb)
#metainit d10 -p c0t4d0s1
d10 = soft partition label (any number but it has to be d "something")
-p = soft partition volume
verify
#metastat (will display detailed info)
#metastat -p
#metastat -c

a.Format the soft partition
#newfs /dev/md/rdsk/d10

b.Mount the soft partition
#mkdir /soft1
#mount /dev/md/dsk/d10 /soft1
df -h (to verify)

c.Make the mount point permanent
#echo "/dev/md/dsk/d10 /dev/md/rdsk/10 /soft1 ufs 1 yes -" >> /etc/vfstab
verify
tail -1 /etc/vfstab

Expand the soft partition by 100mb
#metattach d10 100m
#metastat -c (to verify)
we will have to add blocks because the foundation has been extended.
#growfs -M /soft1 /dev/md/rdsk/d10
-M = specify mountpoint
or
#growfs /dev/md/rdsk/d10 (for unmounted filesystems)

Delete a volume in SVM (delete d10 volume)
a.Unmount the volume
#umount /soft1

b.Remove related line from /etc/vfstab file
#vi /etc/vfstab and dd the line associated with /soft1

c.Delete the soft partition 
#metaclear d10

SVM RAID

SVM has 2 kinds of RAID volumes
a. The concaternation volume (concat volume)
It stores data vertically from one disk to another (from top to bottom).

b.Stripe volume sets
Data is stripped accross the disks in ahorizontal manner in chunks of blocks reffered to as the interplace blocks

concat volumes store data in the disk using only one disk arm at a time while stripe volumes can store chunks of data using 2 or more arms at a time hence stripe volumes are faster in input/output (read/write operations than concat volumes.



A. RAID 0

a.Create a concat volume set using c0t4d0s1 and c0t5d0s1
#metainit d0 2 1 c0t4d0s1 1 c0t5d0s1 (This will create 1 volume called d0 from the 2 disk sets, 1 c0t4d0s1 and 1 c0t5d0s1)
#metastat -p (to verify. it will display the structure)
#metastat -c (will display the size)

b. Create va stripe volume set using c0t4d0s3 and c0t5d0s3
#metainit d1 1 2 c0t4d0s3 c0t5d0s3 (This will create 1 volume called d1 using 2 disk sets c0t4d0s3 c0t5d0s3)
#metastat -c (to verify)
#metastat -p (for structure)
When you see intrlace that means it is stripe volume sets

delete d0 and d1
#metaclear d0 
#metaclear d1

B. RAID 1
Create a RAID 1 volume called d10 from to stripe volume sets
1 create the volume sets
#metainit d0 1 1 c0t4d0s1
#metainit d1 1 1 c0t5d0s1

2. Create the one way mirror set by attaching the first submirror volume
#metainit d10 -m d0

3. Attached the second submirror to raid 1 volume
#metattach d10 d1


Convert a mounted filesystem to an svm volume, then expand the filesystem

convert /export/home into an svm volume and expand it.

1.Convert /export/home into an svm volume
#metainit -f d7 1 1 c0t0d0s7 (This will convert /export/home into a volume)
#metastat -c to verify

2.Modify /etc/vfstab to reflect the change
vi into /etc/vfstab
/dev/md/dsk/d7 /dev/md/rdsk/d7 /export/home ufs 2 yes -

3.Reboot the system gracefully
#init6

Add 5GB disk cook and slice it

4.Verify if /export/home is now on a metadevice
#df -h

5.Expand the /export/home volume (It is a RAID 0 expansion)
d7 + c0t6d0s7 = 26gb ( from 21gb)
#mettach d7 c0t6d0s7
#metastat -c (to verify)
#growfs -M /export/home dev/md/rdskd7 (to expand the mount point)
