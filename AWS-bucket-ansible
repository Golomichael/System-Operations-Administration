LAMP server is used to host multimedia websites that host require a database 
LAMP (Linux, Apache, My sql, PHP)
Static Web (configuration summary)
 
Ansible Server (Used for network Automation)
-can run scripts
Inventory file is in (/etc/ansible/hosts)
[aws-server] ip of your AWS server
-	Ansible Clients (ip address or FDDN)
-	Create an ansible account
-	Generate an RSA key (tranfer key)
AWS Rhel server
-	Create an ansible account
-	Add the account to sudo (assign sudo rigts to the account)
RSA key (Remote security authorization) grants ansible server password less access to the ansible user account on the RHEL AWS server

STEPS
Log into RHEL 8 server
Go to ASA click on ec2 instances
Running instance
RHEL 8 instance
Get ip address
Go to putty and putty into the two servers
Su into root
Installed ansible in server
-	#Yum install epel-release -y  (install epel package)
-	#yum install ansible -y  (install ansible)
Create ansible user account in the two servers
#useradd -m ansible
Ansicble server- centos 7	Cloud server- RHEL 8
1	#useradd -m ansible (create account)	1	#useradd -m ansible (create account)
2	#passwd ansible (create password)	2	#passwd ansible (create password)
3	Su – ansible (Login as ansible)	3	Su – ansible (Login as ansible)
4	#ssh-keygen -t rsa (generate public key)	4	Vi /etc/sudoers
Scroll all the way down to the and add
Press I for insert and add the following lines
Under root ALL=(ALL)

Ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

5	#ssh-copy-id ansible@pu.blic.ip
(Tranfer key from ansible server to ansible account in AWS server.	5	
6	Yes	6	
7	Password	7	
8	#Ssh ansible@pu.blic.ip (verify) (connect to rhel server without asking for password- this allows paswordless access to client)	8	
9	#Vi /etc/ansible/hosts
(Add cloud server/RHEL8 server to inventory list)	9	
10	Scroll all the way down to the bottom and add using O for append
Press I for insert and add the following lines
[aws]
Ip address of AWS cloud RHEL 8 server

Save and quit #wq!

11	#su - ansible	11

Execute standard shell commands or AD-HOC commands in ansible
1.	The Ansible command module (a module is a set of commands that can be pushed to ansible clients by the ansible server)

The command module is used to execute regular shell commands by ansible.

Display the pwd of the ansible user in the AWS RHEL8 ansible client
$ansible aws -m command -a ‘pwd’
-m = specify module
-a = add command
2.	Have ansible display the content of /etc/hosts and the pwd of the ansible user of all AWS server all at once
$ansible aws -m command -a ‘cat /etc/hosts && pwd’ (will fail b/c the command module is limited) the shell module will execute the shell commands without limitations.

3.	The ansible shell module (used to execute shell commands in ansible)
$ansible aws -m shell -a ‘cat /etc/hosts && pwd’

4.	Have ansible create a user account using the shell module in the AWS client.
$ansible aws -m shell -a ‘useradd -c “devops26” -m devops26 (permission denied error or will fail b/c you can’t creaete a user account in standard user mode, and ansible account does not have sudo rights to create the account)
$ansible aws -m shell -a ‘useradd -c “devops26” -m devops26’ - - become (the “- -become” will grant sudo rights to the ansible command)

Verify in the AWS client
$cat /etc/passwd
	 

5.	The file module (used to create file and directories)

Create a file called file26 in the home of the AWS ansible client server
$ansible aws -m file -a ‘path=/home/ansible/file26 state=touch’
State=touch means we are creating a file

Verify on AWS client
$ls ( you should see the file

Have ansible Create a directory called dir26 in the ansible user home of the AWS client.
$ansible aws -m file module -a ‘path=/home/ansible/dir26 state=directory’

To verify in AWS
$ls -l

Have ansible Create a directory called class26aws in the aws client using the file module with permission 777, owner = root of the group root. 
$ansible aws -m file module -a ‘path=/home/ansible/class26aws state=directory mode=777 owner=root group=root’ - -become
Verify in aws
$ls (to make sure it’s there)
$ls -ld class26aws


Have ansible change the permission attribute of the file file26 om AWS as follows; 
Mode=760, owner=root, group=root
$ansible aws -m file module -a ‘path=/home/ansible/file26  mode=760 owner=root group=root’ - -become
To verify in AWS
$ls -l file26

Have ansible delete the file file26 from the ansible user home of the aws server.
 $ansible aws -m file -a ‘path=/home/ansible/file26  state=absent’
State=absent – will delete a file or directory
$ls (to verify in AWS)

6.	The copy module
1.	Use the shell module to copy the /etc/passwd file to the home of the ansible user in aws.
$ansible aws -m shell -a ‘cp /etc/passwd .’
$ls (to verify in AWS)

2.	Use the copy module to copy /etc/hosts to the home of the ansible user in AWS
$ansible aws -m copy -a ‘src=/etc/hosts dest=/home/ansible remote_src=yes’
Remote_src=yes – copy operation should be performed entirely on remote client
$ls (to verify in aws)

3.	Create a directory called diraws1 in the pwd of your ansible user in the ansible server. Have ansible tranfer or copy the file to the ansible user’s home in aws.
$touch f26 (in ansible)
$ansible aws -m copy -a src=/home/ansible/f26 dest-=/home/ansible’
Or
$ansible aws -m copy -a src=f26 dest-=/home/ansible’

$ls (to verify in AWS)
