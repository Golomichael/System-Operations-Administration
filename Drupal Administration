Things to Remember…
● Prepare before you begin
○ Edit your content outside of Drupal - knowing what you are going to add and where it should
go will help streamline the process and make pages less chaotic
○ Collect your images before beginning - Know what images you want, where you would like
them to go in the page, and where they are all stored (on your computer or in your online
database)
○ Resize images before you begin - use copies of images that are as small as possible to help
balance picture quality and data size; smaller images mean shorter load times and less data
usage
● The page automatically adapts for mobile viewers by stacking your content
○ If you are concerned about how your page will look on a phone or tablet, check out your
edits on one of these devices before publishing
○ Simple pages look the cleanest to viewers on all devices. The fewer complexities the
better
● NO TABLES unless they’re needed for exhibiting data
○ Although you may be used to using tables for creating layouts in html, this approach isn’t
compatible with Drupal
● No absolute URLS
○ When creating links within your page, keep the directory system in mind
○ Rather than typing (https://web.gse.harvard.edu/my-file), use (/my-file)
● Use DASHES for attached images and files
○ Just like in URLs, we can’t use spaces or capitals in file names
○ NOT: THIS_is myimage.jpg USE: this-is-my-image.jpg
● Be as specific as possible when naming your files
○ Generic file names clutter the page’s back end; being specific with file names will help make
creating and editing easier
○ NOT: image.jpg, banner.jpg USE: alumni-banner.jpg
● Accessibility tags are required
○ Use ALT and Title Tags when creating pages
● Pages are cached
○ Sometimes it can take up to 15 minutes after publishing a page for it to be visible
● BUT assume that after publishing pages are visible
● Not all users have the same permissions
○ Other users may see something different than you

Accessing Drupal…
Initial Login and Account Setup
● After your account has been created, you will receive a username and temporary password from
your administrator
● Navigate to web.gse.harvard.edu/user
● Enter your username and temporary password
● On your first login, you will be required to create a new password that contains at least 10
characters, one of which is uppercase, one of which is lowercase, one of which is a digit, and one of
which is a non-numeric character (like ! # or %)
Login Instructions
Navigate to: web.gse.harvard.edu/user
● Enter your username and password and select “Log In”
● You can also “Request new password,” which will send a
reset link to the e-mail address associated with your
account

Creating Content…
Types of Content
“Content” is simply information available to the page viewer. There are many different types of
content, each of which has its own format and requires its own specific elements. This system
helps to simplify administration of the page and ensure that everything gets formatted correctly.
Note: each content type has specific permissions, meaning not all users can view or edit all content.
You will be dealing primarily with:
Universal Pages: pages available to anyone on the internet, to provide information about your
office and its functions
Finding Content
In Drupal a piece of Content is also called a Node. Each page can have one node or several. There
are several ways to find content.
Edit Form
While logged in as an administrator,
viewing pages on the website will
provide you with more options.
Click on the “Edit” button directly while
looking at the content you would like to
change.
Workbench
This is a collection of all content listed by title. To access your workbench select
the “My Workbench” button visible in the top left-hand corner any time you are
logged in. Content that you have created or edited recently will be listed at the top. You can also
search for specific content in the list. Content that you have permission to edit will have an “edit”
option in the Action column at the far right.
To search for specific content, scroll to the bottom of your Workbench and select “view all.” You can
scan the list or filter content by entering criteria into the search bar available on this page and
selecting “Apply.” The content below will change to show only content that matches your search
criteria. Select “Reset” to get back to a full list of content.
5
Bookmarks
Also available in the top-left of your screen is the Bookmarks section. You can create bookmarks by
scrolling to the bottom of a piece of Content that you would like to track more easily and selecting
“Bookmark This.”
Once you locate the content you were searching for, clicking on a title allows you to view the node as it
appears on the site. Clicking on edit will take you directly to the edit form.
Creating Content
To draft new content, select “Add Content” from the toolbar in the top-left of your screen. You will
be directed to the “Create Universal Page” section where you can build a new page from scratch.
For more details about your options on this page, see the Editing Content section on page 7.
6
Editing Content…
If you click “edit” in the content list page or on the page itself you will enter editing mode.
On the left side you will see a list of tabs, which vary by
content type and permissions. Each tab reveals different
fields or page settings. Tabs with red * denote required
fields. You will not be able to save a page with empty
required fields.
Universal Page:
● Group, Title, Body
Any page you have permission to edit is
automatically placed within the correct
editorial group. You should only click in
this field to place it there when you are
creating new content.
The only required field for creating a
Universal Page is the ‘Title’ field within this tab. Once you input the title, you will be free to
save the page and come back to it at your leisure.
The ‘Body’ field is where you create most of the content that visitors will see when they
visit the page. Although much of the content will be pre-formatted, this field is comprised
of a Wysiwyg, which you can read more about on page 9.
● Accordion
This tab can be used to create accordions,
like the one shown at left, which show up at
the bottom of the page. They include the
‘Title,’ which shows up condensed in bold,
and the ‘Body,’ which contains information
that expands when clicked on. The ‘Body’ tab
is comprised of a Wysiwyg, which you can
read more about on page 9. To add more
elements to an accordion, select “Add
Another Item” at the bottom of the screen
● Additional Fields
○ Under ‘Banner Image,’ you can upload a custom banner image which will show at the top of
the page. Make sure to follow the resolution and size specifications or the image will not
load properly.
○ ‘Sub Headline’ gives you the option of creating a smaller subtitle that appears under the
headline, but will still be distinct from the body text.
7
○ ‘Intro Text’ is a brief paragraph that summarizes the page contents in 250 characters or
less. It is a plain text function, meaning you cannot add links, pictures, or special
formatting.
○ ‘Topic Category’ and ‘Academic Program Category’ are organizational tools that will be
helpful for people doing a search for specific information that your page may relate to, or
browsing on another part of the website.
● Flags
Check the ‘Bookmark This’ box to add this page to your bookmarks for easy access.
● Revision Information
Put information about any changes you have made in this section after making edits. This will
be available to your editor and can be helpful in streamlining the approval process so that your
changes get published quickly.
You can change the page’s ‘Moderation State’ to help your editor know whether or not your
changes should be published. Selecting “Current: Draft” will not submit your changes for
editing, but will make them available for you to continue editing later. Selecting “Needs
Review” will submit your changes for approval and publishing.
Publishing Content
After you have finished making changes, return to the ‘Revision Information’ tab and change the
moderation state to ‘Needs Review.” Then select “Save” on the bottom left side of the page. This
will send your changes to your editor, who has to approve them before the page goes live on the
website.
It is important to assume any changes you submit will be published immediately. Editing
with this attitude will help you avoid mistakes.
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)
Wysiwygs are designed to make web editing as simple as editing a Word document. Although most
of the formatting is pre-set to create uniformity across the site, you have some options available
while composing content within a wysiwyg.
Common formatting options include: Bold, Italics, ● bulleted and (1) numbered lists, and indentations.
8
Our wysiwygs automatically filter out most HTML to ensure that it can’t accidentally break the page
layout. If you are familiar with using HTML, only the following tags can be used within a wysiwyg:
● <a> <blockquote> <br> <cite> <code> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt> <em> <i> <img> <li> <ol>
<p> <span> <strong> <ul>
● Allowed style properties: text-align
Advanced Formatting Options
● Anchor
Anchors can be used with links to help direct your users to specific areas of your page. Highlight
a piece of text that you want to use as an anchor and select the button (pictured above). Later
you can create a link that will direct a user to this location in the body of your page. See the
section below on Links for more information.
● Link
Use the ‘Link’ button in a wysiwyg to create a link that directs your user to specific locations.
This is also your best option for attaching documents or .pdf’s that you want your viewers to
have access to. Highlight the text that you would like to make a link and select the button
(pictured above on the left). Select the link type from the dropdown menu.
● Creating a URL link directs the user to another website on the internet when clicked.
This will navigate the user away from your page. It is the only time that the use of
absolute URLs (like www.website.com/page rather than simply /page) is allowed.
● Creating an anchor link directs the user to an anchor elsewhere in the text that you have
already created.
● Creating an email link opens the user’s default email program and generates a new
message that includes whatever information you put in the form. You are allowed to
enter a ‘To’ email address, a Message Subject and some text for the Message Body.
The user will be able to edit any of these details and choose when to send the message.
● To attach a document instead, select the “Browse Server”
option. A new window will open where you will be automatically
directed to your department’s directory (as shown at left). From
here, you can select files that have already been uploaded, or
add your own by selecting the “Upload” button from the top left
corner.

If you change your mind and want to delete the link without deleting the text that comprises it,
highlight the link and select the ‘unlink’ button (pictured above on the right).
● Linkit
Linkit is the easiest way to direct your user to another piece of content within the
GSE website. Select the button (pictured above at right) and input the page you would like it to
link to. This can be done by typing the content’s title into the search bar, or by searching the site
directory manually by selecting “Open file browser.” The ‘Link URL’ will populate automatically
once you locate the content you are looking for.
● Block Quote
Designating text as a block quote helps draw attention to certain information. The text will
show up in larger and different font from the rest of the body, and will have a gray background.
To create a block quote, highlight the text that you want emphasized and select the button
(pictured above).
● Add Media
Select this button (pictured above) to add images, audio, or video to your page. There are
several options for you to add media:
● Upload: Use this option to add files saved on your computer
○ Pay attention to file size, the maximum file size is 400KB
● Web: Use this option to add content from elsewhere on the internet. You can do
this by copying and pasting the URL from the page where this content is stored, or
by adding an <embed> link provided by the website whose content you are trying
to link
○ The site will search for the media you are trying to add, but it is best to use the
URL of the media itself rather than of a page that contains it
○ Youtube and soundcloud are currently the only supported providers for
<embed> links

● Library: This gives you access to all of the media across the GSE website. There are
search options that can help you filter the results.
● My Files: This give you access to all of the media that you have already uploaded to
the GSE website. There are search options that can help you filter the results.
