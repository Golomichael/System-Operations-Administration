                 Linux Advance Installation

RHEL kickstart
It is an automated unattended installation method. It is used to install several UNITS at a time.

The Kickstart Concept

1. Create the kickstart configuration file. (ks.cfg)

2. Make the file available on the network. Share the file on the network. It can be placed on an ftp, http (Apache), nfs share and an installation media.

3. Boot up the client and modify the kernel line to point to the ks.cfg file

A. Create the ks.cfg file from a linux platform
i. Modify theroot/anaconda-ks.cfg file to create the ks.cfg.
#cd /root
#cp anaconda-ks.cfg

OR

ii. Use the system-config-kickstart tool
-Install the tool
#yum install system-config-kickstart

-Run the tool and create the ks.cfg file
#system-config-kickstart (It must be executed fom the console of the server)

-Partition 
add disk slicing from
root (/ )
/boot around 500MB
SWAP around 3GB
/home (around 8GB)

-Network configuration
DHCP,DNS IP ADDRESS

-Authentication
-Firewall Configuration

B. Move the file to an NFS server in order to share it on the network

#scp ks.cfg student@192.168.1.206:/export 
(If permission denied just chown username <directory destination>

C. Setup RHEL Linux client and modify the kernel line to point to the ks.cfg file

After interrupting client bootup and mounting the iso image ,press tab at 
go at the bottom and add following
(vm....."space ks=nfs:192.168.1.206:/export/ks.cfg ksdevice=eth0
ks=nfs:192.168.1.206:/export/ks.cfg ksdevice=eth0 and hit Enter to start the automated installation


If Apache server
ks=http://server/path
e.g
ks=http://192.168.1.206/kickstart/ks.cfg ksdevice=eth0

ks=file:/kickstart/ks.cfg
