                      Disque naming convention in Linux (centos 6 and 7 or RHEL6/7)


sdx ==>> where x =letter
disk 1 = sda
disk 2 =sdb
disk 3 =sdc


                    The stucture of a linux Disk
in Linux we have 4 partitions
Display all available system disks
#fdisk -l (will display detail information about the disk)
#fdisk -l | more
#fdisk -s /dev/sda  (to display the size of the sda disk)
-l = Displays details
-s = size
#fdisk -s /dev/sda1 (will display the size of the sda1 partition)
#fdisk -l /dev/sda (display detail information about the disk sda)
#fdisk -l /dev/sda2 (to display detail info about the partition sda2)

Display limited information about all system disks
#ls /dev/sd*
#ls /dev/sda* (will display the partitions of the disk sda)


Disk slicing in Linux
1.Create a 1gb partition in the disk sdb on slice 1
#fdisk /dev/sdb (to access sdb in format mode)
:n (to create a new partition)
:p for primary partition(because we do not want to use the entire disk.
:1 (to assign storage to partition 1)
enter (to accept 1 as the default starting cylinder)
:+1G (to assign 1gb of storage to partition 1) 
:p (to display the partition table and verify)
:w (w = write, will save settings and quit to the command prompt)
verify:
#ls /dev/sd*


2. Format or cook the new sdb1 raw partition
#mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
-t = specify desired filesystem tpe
ext4 = Extended filesystem version 4

3.Mount the /dev/sdb1 filesystem
A. create a mountpoint
#mkdir /class26
B. mount the filesystem to the mountpoint
#mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /class26

4.make the mountpoint permanent
file involved
/etc/fstab
fstab  (filesystem table)
cat /etc/fstab

/etc/fstab field label

field 1= device to mount
field 2= mountpoint
field 3= filesystem type
field 4= defaults (can also be used to assign custom security settings to the filesystem)
field 5= Perform Backup indexing or dumps at bootup (1 = yes, 0 = no )
field 6= filesystem check (1 = yes un fsck at bootup, 0= no )

#vi /etc/fstab  (and add the following line)
/dev/sdb1 /class26 ext4 defaults 1 1
or
echo "/dev/sdb1 /class26 ext4 defaults 1 1" >> /etc/fstab
#cat /etc/fstab to verify

If ther is an error in /etc/fstab , the system will crash at bootup and if in /etc/vfstab in solaris then ssh will go offline after rebooting.

PROJECT
1.create a 2gb partition on sdb2
2.format and permanently mount the filesystem at class26a
3.create a user account for Terry ola and place his home in the /class26a filesystem

Note. the system must be rebooted after slicing before you can cook.


1.
#fdisk /dev/sdb2 
:n 
:p 
:2 
enter 
:+2G  
:p 
:w 
reboot before we cook it
2.
#mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb2
mountpoint
#mkdir /class26a
#mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /class26a 
echo "/dev/sdb2 /class26a ext4 defaults 1 1" >> /etc/fstab

3
#useradd -c "Terry Ola" -d /class26a -m tola



   5. Delete a mounted filesystem


Delete the class26 filesystem
1.Unmount the filesystem
#umount /class26

2 Delete the line associated with the filesystem from /etc/fstab
#vi /etc/fstab  (and dd the line associated with /class26)
3. Delete the filesystem
#fdisk /dev/sdb
:d (to delete the filesystem)
:1 (to select partition 1)
:p (to display the partition table and verify)
:w (to save the settings and quit back to the prompt)

4.Delete the mountpoint
#rm -r /class26 (when you delete in Linux it becomes interactive)
#rm -f <file>  (will force a file and prevent the system from becoming interactive)
#rm -rf <directory>
#rm -Rf <files + directories)


#mountall (will mount non system filesystem in Solaris)
#umountall (will umount all non filesystem in Solaris)
#mount -a (will mount all non system filesystem in Linux)
#umount -a (will unmount all non system filesystems in Linux)


                                   IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Resolving a rogue line issue in the file /etc/fstab in Linux

1.Simulate a disaster

#echo "/dev/sdm /hack ext4 defaults 1 1" >> /etc/fstab

2.Disaster recovery
To fix the rogue line, force the system to single usermode with read and write permission.remove the line from /etc/fstab to fix the issue

A.interrupt the bootup process at the GRUB by pressing A on the keyboard 
press A again to access the kernel config line 
Type; rw init=/bin/bash 
and press enter to force the system to single usermode
B. Eddit /etc/fstab (and remove or deactivate the line)
#vi /etc/fstab  (comment (#) line to deactivate it).

                        

                     Rogue line problem in Solaris



In Solaris , a rogue line in /etc/vfstab will cause ssh to go offline, which will result to a connection refused error when trying to ssh into the system.

SSH will go offline in Solaris if ;
1 There is a rogue line in /etc/vfstab
2.There is an ip adress conflict with another system
3.Hostname configuration error. If the hostname of the system is different from the hostname found in the files /etc/hosts ; /etc/hostname.e1000g0 or /etc/nodename, then ssh will go offline at reboot.
