A filesystem serves as a fundamental component of an operating system (OS).

Windows Filesystem Types:

FAT (File Allocation Table)
FAT32
NTFS (New Technology File System)
RAW Disk:
A RAW disk refers to a disk that has no filesystem and has not been formatted yet. Before any data can be stored on a RAW disk, it must be formatted to create a filesystem.

Formatting:
Formatting is the process of creating a filesystem on a disk.

Common Filesystems:

UFS (Unix File System): Default filesystem for Solaris.
XFS (X File System): Default filesystem for RHEL 7/8 and CentOS 7/8.
EXT (Extended File System): Default filesystem for RHEL 6 and CentOS 6.
NFS (Network File System): Used for sharing directories in Linux and Unix.
CIFS (Common Internet File System): Used by Linux systems to mount Windows or Samba shares.
MntFs (Mount File System): Manages all system mount points.
HsFs (High Sierra File System): Used in Solaris to mount optical media.
LoFs (Loop Back File System): Used to mount optical media in Linux.
TempFs (Temporary File System): Temporary storage for files during OS and application installation.
Swapfs (Swap File System): Supports running applications and the OS by providing temporary storage.
Process and Device Filesystems:

Procfs (Process File System): Manages all system processes.
Devfs (Device File System): Manages all system hardware and their respective device drivers.
Components of Devfs:

/dev Directory:

Stores logical names of system hardware devices.
A logical name is a label assigned to a hardware component by the OS.
Administrators interact with hardware devices using their logical names (e.g., e1000g0 for a network interface card).
/devices Directory:

Stores system hardware physical names.
A physical name is the OS's description of the hardware componentâ€™s device driver.
The OS interacts with hardware components using their physical names.
/etc/path_to_instance File:

Stores instance names of system hardware devices.
An instance name is the kernel's abbreviation of the physical name.
The kernel interacts with hardware devices using their instance names.
Cheat Sheet:

Devfs:
/dev: Logical names used by administrators.
/devices: Physical names used by the OS.
/etc/path_to_instance: Instance names used by the kernel.
The physical name is a symbolic link to the instance name.

Project:
Given the logical name e1000g0:
a) Find its physical name.
b) Find its instance name.
