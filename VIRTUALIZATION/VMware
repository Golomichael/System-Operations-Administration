                     VIRTUALIZATION                                


                         I) VMware 
. It is  an American publicly traded software company. It provides virtualization software , cloud computing and services.

.Vmware has 80% of virtualization market share

.The name = V M WARE (Hardware + Software)

.There are two main virtualization software
VMWare plater = Runs over operating system
VMWare hypervisor = Bare-metal hypervisor runs over a hardware without having an operating system



          II) Products in VMWare
.VMWare Workstation player
We can use it to use it to run virtual machine

.VMWare vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi)
Bare-metal  hypervisor that installs directly onto your physical server

.VMWare vSphere client
interface that allows you to connect to a hypervisor
It is a client just like RDP (PUTTY)
It is web based client

.VMWare vCenter
Used to manage multiple hypervisor



          III) Importance of VMWare 
.System administration
.Network/storage administration
.Programming or development (Automationor testing
.Database or application administration (DB or Apps run OS and OS runs on VMs
.Cloud (most of 90% run on virtual environment).


                      Lab Design
 in corporate we have to do it with redundancy
VMWare lab URL
http://labs.hol.vmware.com

.Download and install vSphere ESXi server (it is the virtualization layer ontop of the vmware player

.Make the IP static on the console

.Access the esxi server we have to use a browser and use the IP adress to connect to it

vSphere HA: (high availability)

            CONFIGURATION

Desktop/Laptop==>> VMWare workstation player==>> VM ==>> ESXi==>> VMs


 




                      VMWare on single ESXi

Laptop ==> VMWare player ==> vSphere ESXi ==> VM

Attach ISO image to host.
Create a directory called ISO to store all our ISO images in oerder to use it to create virtual machines on our VMware vSphere ESXi environement.

                    

                           VM management
As admin we should manage vSphere ESXi and VMs too.

*Update ESXi Hostname
In coporate world we have multiple hypervisor so we have to respect a naming standards.
Reload after changement

Install windows machine


         Install VMWare tools on a VM
It should br installed on a VM in order to pull out the accurate information for better monitoring,and software can functione properly etc. It  provides necessary drivers.

Go to action and install it


         Review VMs and Modify Ressources

we cannot make changes on cpu or memory unless we shutdown the vm
add more storage (simple volume and assign unallocated space)


                   VM Snapshots
What is a snapshot
.A snapshot preserves the state and data of virtual machine at a specific point in time.
.The state includes the virtual machines'power state(for example, powered on, powered off, suspended
.The data includes all the files that make up the virtual machine. This includes disks, memory and other devices such as virtual network interface cards.

Snapshot is not a backup !!!!



              vCenter installation and configuration 

Create a new VMWare esxi and add memory 12*1024 since we do not have the GB option we have to convert it.

What is VMWare vCenter?
vCenter is a centralized management utility for VMWare.
It supports function like HA,vMotion,vDS,vSAN,SSO,update manager ,host profiles, vRealize orchestrator and many more.

.The newer version comes pre-packaged as an appliance (OS + Application) that can be installed on ESXi as VM.



            vCenter Appliance Download and install options
 
1)How to download vCenter 

PSC:platform service controller

           Accessing vCenter
.Browser
*Flash (provide fully qualified domain name "administrator@vsphere.local")
*HTML5

.Console (within web-client
.SSH
.vCenter Management Interface (we should provide the port)


            Vcenter management interface

https://192.168.111.138:5480

Backup
Create support bundle: open a ticket for vmware support
reboot
shutdown

             
                   Create a Datacenter and add ESXi servers

1)Login to vCenter
2) Create a datacenter
3) Add Esxi1
4) Add esxi2
